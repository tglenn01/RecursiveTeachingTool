# Recursive Function Analysis

# Milestone-1
 
### 1) who you think would want to use your analysis
Beginner CS students
### 2) what they would use it for
Visualise recursion call flow, debugging a function
### 3) why it would make sense for them to use it
Following recursive control flow can be difficult to follow, to see the order in which sub calls are made easily, to see how long each subcall takes, analyse performance.

## Description: 
* Use dynamic (maybe static as well if we have time) program analysis to visualise the control flow of a recursive function.
* For dynamic analysis, take userâ€™s code and parameters to the function, and dynamically generate the call stack.
* Depending on the analyses we want to do, we may have to make some trade-offs with any static analysis (ex. Maybe we want our analysis to always terminate even in an infinite recursive call)
* For visual representation, use React components to generate a tree like structure of recursive calls including the parameters and other valuable information for each call
